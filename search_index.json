In DMD 300, students participated in a group design project, and developed their own independent project using digital formats and tools of their choosing. In DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone, students will have the opportunity to develop a focused capstone project.\nCourse description\nIn this capstone, students develop portfolio projects by applying creative production concepts, tools, and approaches to a contemporary issue. DMD 400 Digital Multimedia Design Capstone is an advanced, senior-level capstone experience, students will synthesize the concepts, tools, and approaches learned throughout their studies and demonstrate competencies in creative and technical production in an applied human-centered thesis project. Students will work as change agents to address a critical, real-world, local or global issue or challenge and work through the design process to complete a capstone project. Students will explore processes in interdisciplinary problem spaces and connect to broader context of design decisions promoting agency over project outcomes, applications, deliverables, and knowledge-sharing.\nStudent projects will include design proposals and/or implementations for digital or physical products and systems. To examine their understanding of design leadership, students will practice design thinking and production methods to generate project ideas, discover opportunities, and communicate intent; practice systems thinking to define the boundaries and impact of a problem space; and practice critical thinking to evaluate research issues, develop meaning, and inspire creative output. Students will be able to deploy project management skills to ensure on-time delivery of final project, communicate project concepts through visual models, and will leverage a variety of digital resources and methods to disseminate work in online contexts including social media, websites, and others.\n"},"assessment.html":{"url":"assessment.html","title":"Assessment","keywords":"","body":"Assessment\nSee Canvas for the course schedule.\nStudents in DMD-400 are assessed on their ability to synthesize a feasible design project, produce deliverables on time, and engage with a design process they outlined for the project.\nTo pass the course, students must meet the capstone requirements indicated in the capstone project section. Students will spend the entire course developing a single capstone project, including check-ins and development stages.\nFinal Project\nBy taking this course you are not guaranteed to pass it simply by turning in a final project and completing production reports and other projects. Your final project must incorporate feedback from your professor, external reviewers, and peers. You must document and show your efforts to explore feedback in your work and production reports. \nAt the midterm and final review, your work will be reviewed by external reviewers. If you project is not meeting the DMD program requirements you will be given a warning at midterm. If this warning is not acted upon and you ignore your professor’s feedback leading up to your final you could fail the course and need to retake it. Your final project, once reviewed by external reviewers, will be deemed viable or not viable by the DMD program faculty. If your final project does not meet the requirements of the DMD program you will not pass the course.\nIn order to pass this course you must earn a C or better. In order for your final project to be included in the exhibition your actual final project must earn a C or better.\nProduction Reports\nStudents will be required to post regular updates on a blog or similar online platform to document their research and progress throughout the semester. The points for these reports are not guaranteed and will not be awarded if your report does not meet the criteria.\nIncremental Process Assignment\nThese include miscellaneous check-ins, drafts of writing, and required Zoom meetings with the instructor. The points for these assignments are not guaranteed and will not be awarded if your assignment does not meet the criteria.\n"},"concept-development.html":{"url":"concept-development.html","title":"Concept development","keywords":"","body":"Concept development\nIn DMD 100, students are guided through the entire production of design projects through a careful orchestration of design thinking exercises and a set of rules or criteria that bounded the scope. The rules set in place made it so that the student could concentrate on the content of the project, rather than finding an appropriate scale and bounds for the project. In a capstone project, students are responsible for managing the design methods used in the project as well as the content and results of the project.\nDeveloping a good design project concept\nRequired features of a good capstone project concept:\n\nMatches your interests\nWell scoped\nStrategically aligned\nUnderstandable by others\n\nFeatures of impactful and relevant project concepts (Has one or more of the following)\n\nIdentifies or solves problems for people, organizations, and businesses\nInvention and/or unexpected combinations to produce novelty\nLinks to relevant cultural, historical, social contexts\nExplores moral and ethical issues or quandaries\nAesthetic and theoretical explorations\n\nMatching interests\nWhat are you most interested in making? Are you a game designer or 3D animator? Do you want to make illustrations or pre-viz concept art for animated films? Or are you interested in UX design and research? The DMD Program's capstone course is the place where you can put everything you have into one project that can ideally be used for your portfolio. You will be working on this one project the entire semester, and so it is vitally important that you care about the project that you are making.\nScoping your project\nYou should scope your project based on what you can do, or if you are a fast learner, how quickly you can up-skill to meet the needs of your project's production. Some students come into capstone with advanced art and design skills, subject matter knowledge, and even some real-world experience. Others students come into the capstone course with far fewer refined skills and understanding. It's important that the capstone project matches existing skills and abilities, or requires only a bit more development than what you currently have. Overestimating your own skills or assuming you can master the requisite competencies and capabilities in time for production may result in bad outcomes.\nAnother scope consideration for project scope is the amount of production you can realistically accomplish. It's better to have a smaller, more well developed and communicated project than a large, multi-faceted project that will be overwhelming, poorly developed, not well documented, and perhaps impossible to accomplish in the time you will have. If your project is engaging with important critical or social issues, keep in mind that your project likely won't save the world, so try to have a realistic goal about what the impact will be.\nAlign your project strategically\nThe capstone will be a lot of work, and so undoubtedly, it should have as much positive impact as possible. It makes sense for many students to align their project outcomes with a future job role they are applying for. Other students may want to push themselves creatively as far as possible, and are looking for the best way to showcase their storytelling and visual communication skills. For others, this could be a good time to finally apply their skills they have been mastering in a particular software or technique. Finally, some students want to apply their skills in having a real-world impact of some kind, whether it's raising awareness of a cause or addressing an important need.\nThere are three main strategic questions you should be able to answer:\n\nDoes this project align with what you want to make?\nDoes this project communicate the capabilities and competencies I want to show?\nDoes this project have the impact I want it to have?\n\nBe accurate and clear\nIs the project understandable by others? Articulating what you want to do clearly and completely can take some practice. Try to avoid hyperbole, generalist language, stereotypes and clichés, and vague explanations. For example, are you developing \"an app\" or simply proposing app wire frames of a fictional app for a UX case study? Are you developing a comic book, or a digital comic that never goes to print? A good way to test the clarity of your concept is to ask others to ask you what it's about. If you struggle to explain the concept or others struggle to understand your explanation, it's possible that you need to revise how you are talking about it, or the concept itself requires some refining.\nIncorporating themes and issues in your project (optional)\nA theme is a core idea (or set of ideas) that signify basic values, motivations and practices inherent in a project. A project lacking strong theme development tends to be shallow and without regard for cultural and community contexts, which will become apparent during discussion and critique. There are two typical approaches to identifying project themes. The directed concept approach refers to when themes are established and defined at the beginning stages of project development, and the emerging concept approach is were the themes are allowed to emerge and evolve during the production of a project.\nTypically, an artist producing a project that focuses on storytelling of critical issues relies on their everyday observations, life experiences, and important moments to spark their ideas. It is helpful to carry a small notebook or store a running list of ideas on a mobile device. Ideas can leave your mind as quickly as they come, so it's important to develop a habit of recording your ideas no matter how small. Themes that the artist/design have direct interaction with are those they have most agency to make work about, and are more likely to result in more authentic and honest stories.\nSituating (Directed approach):\n\n\"Top-down\" approach\nProcess of deduction\nTheory » Hypothesis » Observation » Confirmation\n\nConcepts are directed through a mapping process either before or in the beginning stages of a project. An interpretation of outcomes of an inquiry will depend in part on the frame of reference of existing knowledge. What is known helps identify what is not. Situating is a method that opens up lines of inquiry commonly used to review literature and information sources in the public domain. Situating is a curatorial process for looking at existing things in new ways.\nRevealing (Emerging approach):\n\n\"Bottom-up\" approach\nProcess of induction\nObservations » Pattern » Hypothesis » Theory\n\nThemes emerge over the course of the project through an ongoing discovery process. A core purpose of inquiry is to discover new knowledge or the possibility of thinking about things in new, innovative ways. To reveal something relies on others experiencing a change of awareness or understanding. Revealing, therefore is not only a method of discovery, but requires multiple ways of communicating to target groups and others. Depending on your interests, you don't always have to develop the core theme or issue.

Capstone's are typically individual projects, though you have the option to enlist the help of peer DMD students who may have complimentary skills to help bring your project to fruition. The capstone project must include a major research component, demonstrated media production skills and techniques, and participation in the online  capstone project exhibition. Capstone projects must be able to be completed within the duration of the capstone experience. In order to successfully complete the capstone project, a good understanding of media, production workflows, and project scope will be needed. You will produce documentation, meet deliverable and milestone deadlines, introduce relevant theory and analysis, and participate in the capstone project online exhibition. Students who do not earn a B or better on their project assessment will not be able to participate in the online capstone exhibition.\nProject deliverables\nThe capstone project is broken down into the following deliverable categories.

Project advisor","keywords":"","body":"Project advisor\nCapstone projects require one or more project advisors. You should meet with this advisor at minimum three times throughout the development of the capstone project. A project advisor can play a crucial role in your project's development. While your instructors are often able to provide insight into the majority of your project's challenges, having feedback from someone working in the industry can give you more nuanced and accurate perspectives, more up-to-date expectations, and pointed notes for improvement. You can also use this opportunity to start building your professional network, which makes future employment in the your creative field of choice far easier.\nSeeking out professionals in the field who are open to working with students can be challenging. Often if students are not successful, the capstone instructor will provide an introduction connection through their own professional network. Sometimes students have someone already in their own network, and sometimes students reach out to people they do not yet know (LinkedIn.com is a great place for this). DMD faculty are often available to act as project advisors as well, though they should be thought of as a last resort. \nWhile it would be nice to assume the everyone in the professional world will be respectful and trustworthy, communicating with strangers that have not been vetted can come with some risk. Please let your instructor know of any issues that might arise. Some project advisors will give you very honest (sometimes brutal) and direct feedback. Being able to listen and receive, interpret, and apply feedback to your own work is part of the job of being a design professional.\nPlaces to search for a project advisor\n\nThe DMD LinkedIn Alumni Group\nRequest to join if you are not already a member\n\n\nLinkedIn.com\nList of Game Development professionals\n(3D art, audio, animation, art direction, character art, concept art, story, production, VFX, programming, MoCap, lighting, level design, environment artist, engineering, tech art, UI design, writing, etc.)\n\n\nCapstone instructor's professional network\nDMD or other Penn State Faculty\nCommunities of practice (Facebook groups, forums, ArtStation.com, Behance.net, core77.com, etc.)\nProfessional membership community chapters\nAIGA\nACM SIGGRAPH\nIDSA\n\n\nADP List\n\nSending an email or direct message\nHere is an example of an email that you could write to someone to try to elicit their feedback.

If you struggle to complete a proof of ability for your intended project, you may need to rethink the scope of your work, or reduce the need for complex technical skills. You can still convey a compelling project idea by being resourceful and adaptable in the production approach when faced with insurmountable technical obstacles.\nThe proof itself depends on the type of project and media being used. However, there are standard ways of showing competency in a given craft.

Research","keywords":"","body":"Project research expectations\nResearch expectations can differ between projects. For the Digital Multimedia Design Capstone course, students can select from a variety of media types that correspond to their fields of interest. Research is integral to the design process that you will be using for the capstone project, and therefore, everyone will incorporate appropriate research methods into their production timelines. The importance of conducting research can be summed up by the following:\nResearch...\n\nContextualizes your work within the broader landscape of work;\nHelps to base your design work on current standards and the latest thinking in the discipline;\nEliminates as much harmful bias as possible. Everyone will inevitably bring bias to the design process;\nA well researched project leads to a credible, unique, and a well designed project.\nCan be conducted via a \"method\" (methodology is the study of methods, outside the scope of this degree program)\nDrives your design decisions based on credible ideas, facts, and data — communicating the rationale of your design decisions;\nHelps to transform vague problems into understandable problems through exploration and investigation\nProvides a \"systems\" context and awareness (historical, professional, cultural, social, political, environmental, economic, etc.)  to a problem space.\n\nUniversal requirements\nResearch can mean many things in the context of an digital art or design project. Here are some commonalities between capstone projects:\n\nProjects may include research into the tools, techniques, and methods that may be best suited to completing the project.\nMost projects are visual in nature, and will likely include visual research of some kind.\nWhen working with sensitive or discipline specific subjects outside of your expertise such as health, social issues, politics, the environment, etc., you will need to rely on credible experts or scholarly publications as your sources for data.\nCited sources should be from scholarly publications. Google Scholar search engine is a good starting point.\n\nPrimary vs secondary research\nPrimary research is the research that you produce yourself. If you conduct a survey, that is considered primary research. If you reference someone else's survey, then that would be considered secondary research. Conducting research has many ethical and credibility implications, the type of primary research students conduct in this class would mainly be used to direct the design decisions of their own project and would not be publicized as being applicable elsewhere. Those who have go to graduate school and are trained to conduct primary research are the only ones qualified to publish findings to a wider audience, often in peer reviewed publications where the data, findings, and methods can be analyzed and tested by others.\nDiscipline specific\nChoose the research that best suits your project's intended outcomes.\nIf you are creating products or services, you may do research into existing ones to better understand what has been done and how your project will stand out. You may conduct visual research for interface design, or use a variety of UX research methods to help you as the designer understand how users interact with a product or service without making too many assumptions (bias). This could take the form of a survey, a prototype test, conducting a poll, or other ux research methods that have been developed for this field. These projects will tend to include the most primary research of all project types.\nIf you are creating a video game, you may need to research certain relevant history, game theory, or various design research related to developing characters and props in your game. The research that you conduct depends of the scope of work and what aspect of the game's design you are emphasizing. This could be story, game play, environment or character design, etc. Each of or combinations of these areas could require research. See this project's research as an example for good game design research. For example, if you are making a project that takes place in 200 B.C. in a particular region of the world, you will need to conduct secondary research to find written or visual information of that period that helps inform the design of your sets, props, and characters. Simply copying other game designs would not constitute you as having completed research as those designs are interpretations rather than sources.\nIf you are creating a graphic design project, you may start by researching case studies of similar projects, look into the history or context of the subject matter you are designing for, and get a better understanding of client or business goals through a variety of research methods. If you are doing video or photography, perhaps you will do research into other artists, films, or work that you may try to emulate.\nIf you are designing mostly fiction, you will need to inspire your fictional design from something. All design for the most part can be referenced back to other design work or naturally occurring phenomenon. This is where reference sheets can come in as a visual research method, where you can assemble visuals that help guide the design process. Let's say you are designing a spaceship for a fictional universe, how would you create rules around that that universe might look like? Here is an example with the art director from the Ridley Scott film, Prometheus, discussing the inspiration for the production design.\nNot sure where to start?

Explainer video","keywords":"","body":"Project explainer video\nProduce a short video presentation that documents and explains the project process and outcomes for a general audience unfamiliar with the work (~2-3 minutes).\nExample of excellent explainer videos\n\nA world of our own by Grace Brown\n\nStructuring the presentation\nThere are different approaches to documentation video. A typical documentation video consists of the following:\n\nProject title and name screen\nConcept: Short overview statement, typically white, bold text on a black background. Ensure that it is visible on screen long enough to be read by the viewer.\nResearch: Photographs, images or video clips showing the research or key aspects that you developed to make the project successful.\nProduction process: Photographs, images or video clips showing the production of the project at various stages of development. You can photograph yourself or others participating in the experience or show relevant digital images that give the audience context of your narration. \nFigure out the best way to communicate the things you are making. This can be screen captured videos or images, photographs of in-progress work, diagrams, etc.\n\n\nProject outcomes: Include any of the following — Results of the project, insights, lessons learned, and plans for the future.\n\nYou can overlay text on top of the images and video to describe the project's development and outcomes along with voice narration to describe the project. Do not leave the images and video up to interpretation.\nCreating and exporting the video (recommended)\n\nCreate a presentation folder on your computer and save everything to this folder.\nCreate a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation in widescreen aspect ratio\nExport the slides as images\nRecord an audio narration for each slide using quicktime (should be about 1-3 minutes of audio)\nImport the images and audio into premiere pro or aftereffects\nEdit and export using H.264 format. This should be a small file size. \n\nAdditional software tutorials\nRecording and editing software\n\nScreen Recording\nApple Quicktime\nHow record your screen with Quicktime\n\n\nScreenflow (free trial)\nCamtasia (free trial)\nLinkedIn Learning\n\n\nZoom\nUsing Zoom to record a slides presentation\n\n\nVideo Editors (NLE)\nAdobe Premiere Pro — Great all purpose editor\nAdobe Premiere Pro: Adding text to video\nEssential Training (LinkedIn Learning)\n\n\nAdobe AfterEffects — For fancy animations\nEssential Training: Motion Graphics (LinkedIn Learning)\n\n\nAdobe Spark — For simple slideshow videos — Easy!\nTelling a Story with Adobe Spark (LinkedIn Learning)\n\n\n\n\n\nExporting Your Video\nVideos should be exported as a .mp4 file with an h.264 codec. This is most common format for distributing videos on the web. \n1920px x 1080px is standard HD video size, so that's a great target to make your video, but if you have a conceptual or technical reason you need to size your video differently, other sizes may be acceptable. \n\nHow to export in H.264 format with Adobe Premiere\n\nVideos should be smaller than 500MB. To decrease your file size, you can try the following:\n\nEnsure you are using the h.264 codec when exporting. Use the share feature in quicktime to export a large video.\nDecrease your video's bitrate in the export settings (for reference check out the recommended bitrate settings for YouTube). Bitrate is basically how much detail goes into each frame of your video.\nIf you aren't happy with the results from that you can always decrease the overall size of your video to 1280px by 720px or something similar.\n\nSubmission details\nSubmit this video as part of the documentation step.\n"},"capstone-project-exhibition.html":{"url":"capstone-project-exhibition.html","title":"12.
