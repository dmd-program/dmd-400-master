In that course, students participated in a group design project, and developed their own independent project using digital formats and tools of their choosing. In DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone, students will have the opportunity to develop a focused capstone project.\nCourse description\nIn this capstone, students develop portfolio projects by applying creative production concepts, tools, and approaches to a contemporary issue. DMD 400 Digital Multimedia Design Capstone is an advanced, senior-level capstone experience, students will synthesize the concepts, tools, and approaches learned throughout their studies and demonstrate competencies in creative and technical production in an applied human-centered thesis project. Students will work as change agents to address a critical, real-world, local or global issue or challenge and work through the design process to complete a capstone project. Students will explore processes in interdisciplinary problem spaces and connect to broader context of design decisions promoting agency over project outcomes, applications, deliverables, and knowledge-sharing.\nStudent projects will include design proposals and/or implementations for digital or physical products and systems. To examine their understanding of design leadership, students will practice design thinking and production methods to generate project ideas, discover opportunities, and communicate intent; practice systems thinking to define the boundaries and impact of a problem space; and practice critical thinking to evaluate research issues, develop meaning, and inspire creative output. Students will be able to deploy project management skills to ensure on-time delivery of final project, communicate project concepts through visual models, and will leverage a variety of digital resources and methods to disseminate work in online contexts including social media, websites, and others.\n"},"assessment.html":{"url":"assessment.html","title":"Assessment","keywords":"","body":"Assessment\nSee Canvas for the course schedule.\nStudents in DMD-400 are assessed on their ability to synthesize a feasible design project, produce deliverables on time, and engage with a design process they outlined for the project.\nTo pass the course, students must meet the capstone requirements indicated in the capstone project section. Students will spend the entire course developing a single capstone project, including check-ins and development stages.\nFinal Project\nBy taking this course you are not guaranteed to pass it simply by turning in a final project and completing production reports and other projects. Your final project must incorporate feedback from your professor, external reviewers, and peers. You must document and show your efforts to explore feedback in your work and production reports. \nAt the midterm and final review, your work will be reviewed by external reviewers. If you project is not meeting the DMD program requirements you will be given a warning at midterm. If this warning is not acted upon and you ignore your professor’s feedback leading up to your final you could fail the course and need to retake it. Your final project, once reviewed by external reviewers, will be deemed viable or not viable by the DMD program faculty. If your final project does not meet the requirements of the DMD program you will not pass the course.\nIn order to pass this course you must earn a C or better. In order for your final project to be included in the exhibition your actual final project must earn a C or better.\nProduction Reports\nStudents will be required to post regular updates on a blog or similar online platform to document their research and progress throughout the semester. The points for these reports are not guaranteed and will not be awarded if your report does not meet the criteria.\nIncremental Process Assignment\nThese include miscellaneous check-ins, drafts of writing, and required Zoom meetings with the instructor. The points for these assignments are not guaranteed and will not be awarded if your assignment does not meet the criteria.\n"},"concept-development.html":{"url":"concept-development.html","title":"Concept development","keywords":"","body":"Concept development\nA concept is a core idea (or set of ideas) that signify basic values, motivations and practices inherent in a project. A project lacking strong concept development tends to be shallow and without regard for cultural and community contexts, which will become apparent during discussion and critique. There are two typical concept development approaches. The directed concept approach refers to when a concept is established and defined at the beginning stages of project development, and the emerging concept approach is were the concept is allowed to emerge and evolve during the production of a project.\nSituating (Directed concept approach):\n\n\"Top-down\" approach\nProcess of deduction\nTheory » Hypothesis » Observation » Confirmation\n\nConcepts are directed through a mapping process either before or in the beginning stages of a project. An interpretation of outcomes of an inquiry will depend in part on the frame of reference of existing knowledge. What is known helps identify what is not. Situating is a method that opens up lines of inquiry commonly used to review literature and information sources in the public domain. Situating is a curatorial process for looking at existing things in new ways.\nRevealing (Emerging concept approach):\n\n\"Bottom-up\" approach\nProcess of induction\nObservations » Pattern » Hypothesis » Theory\n\nConcepts emerge over the course of the project through an ongoing discovery process. A core purpose of inquiry is to discover new knowledge or the possibility of thinking about things in new, innovative ways. To reveal something relies on others experiencing a change of awareness or understanding. Revealing, therefore is not only a method of discovery, but requires multiple ways of communicating to target groups and others.\n\nA project concept is always in support of an overarching theme or purpose. A well developed concept can help the artist or designer to ask questions in novel or provocative ways or to find new approaches to solving problems or eliciting emotional responses. Once you have the concept, all decisions are for the purpose of expressing it as effectively as possible. Depending on your interests, you don't always have to develop the core theme or issue.

However, more often than not, everyday observations are enough to spark an idea. It is helpful to keep around a small notebook or store a running list of ideas on a mobile device.\nKey features of a good concept:\n\nFeasible to accomplish in the given timeframe\nInvention and/or unexpected combinations to produce novelty \nLinks to relevant cultural, historical, social contexts\nExplores moral and ethical issues or quandaries\nAesthetic and theoretical explorations\n\nIn DMD 100, students are guided through the entire production of three projects through a careful orchestration of design thinking exercises and a set of rules or criteria that bounded the scope. The rules set in place made it so that the student could concentrate on the content of the project, rather than finding an appropriate scale and bounds for the project. In a capstone project, students are responsible for establishing these rules for themselves, an often difficult task that takes practice to master.\n"},"capstone-project.html":{"url":"capstone-project.html","title":"Capstone project","keywords":"","body":"Capstone project\nA capstone project represents the culmination of your interests and skills developed throughout your studies. Capstone's are typically individual projects, though you have the option to enlist the help of peer DMD students who may have complimentary skills to help bring your project to fruition. The capstone project must include a major research component, demonstrated media production skills and techniques, and participation in the online  capstone project exhibition. Capstone projects must be able to be completed within the duration of the capstone experience. In order to successfully complete the capstone project, a good understanding of media, production workflows, and project scope will be needed. You will produce documentation, meet deliverable and milestone deadlines, introduce relevant theory and analysis, and participate in the capstone project online exhibition.\nProject deliverables\nThe capstone project is broken down into the following deliverable categories. See each category for more information about deliverable requirements:\n\nProposal\nAgreement form\nProof of concept\nProgress reports\nStatement\nProject document\nProject explainer video\nCapstone project exhibition\n\nExpectations\nEach project should demonstrate a minimum of entry-level skills for their chosen field.\n\nDefine a project proposal\nOutcomes\nContext and impact\nThemes\nScope: What can you do in 1 semester?\nIdentify a production process and timeline\nIdentify faculty or industry mentor\nIf a group project, what roles and workload must be defined.\n\n\nMinimum of three (3) Check-ins with advisor, mentor, or client.\nNotes or takeaways from meeting\nStudent facilitates meeting by being prepared to show progress, prepare questions ahead of time, and schedule meetings.\n\n\nAccount for faculty reviewer feedback. Failure to consider reviewer feedback can result in a lower overall project grade, particularly if the project outcomes suffered as a result of ignoring advice or analysis.  \nProject deliverables\nProject should either be based on a clearly defined career intention or a well defined concept and theme. Expressive projects must be well articulated in the project statement.\n\n\nDeliver a final presentation and contribution for student exhibition of work.\n\nTypes\nWhile project types may overlap, in general, they can be broken down into a few types. You can map project categories to the following:\n\nClient-based project\nThis project is based on fulfilling stakeholder needs and requirements.\n\n\nExperimental and experiential art or design\nThis type refers to creative projects that feature aesthetic explorations often based on new or existing theory and practices. \nOften the purpose of experimental work is to create new knowledge, explore meaning, and phenomenology.\n\n\nStory-driven\nStory driven projects comprise of fictional or non-fictional stories told through digital narrative media. These stories can be either new or reimagined existing stories.\n\n\n\n"},"capstone-project-proposal.html":{"url":"capstone-project-proposal.html","title":"1.

This statement should be developed with feedback from your instructor to adjust tone, terminology, and structure. You will use MS Word tracked changes to refine and edit the statement over the duration of the project.\nThe statement's use of language should seek a balance of accurate technical terminology, concise statements about the work, and language that is accessible to a diverse audience and is wholly descriptive. It is easy for artists and designers to adopt opaque language when attempting to describe abstract works. Developing playful language can be a fun exercise, but has the tendency to confuse or shut out those with-out a strong grasp of obscure and creatively constructed language. There are really no rules with how language is used, but ultimately the goal in a work statement is that the artist or designer can clearly communicate their ideas, processes, and outcomes to a wide audience. \nStructure of the statement\nPlease write the statement in essay form using proper grammar, sentence structure, and with complete paragraphs. Do not copy and paste the following list of requirements into your statement. Instead, the statement should flow as a single description of your project.
