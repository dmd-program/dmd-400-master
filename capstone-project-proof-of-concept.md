# Proof of concept

A proof of concept is a small demonstration of a skill or capability that is indicative of your ability to complete a larger work using the same tools and techniques. If you struggle to complete a proof of concept for your intended project, you may need to rethink the scope of your work, or reduce the need for complex technical skills. You can still convey a compelling project idea by being resourceful and adaptable in the production approach when faced with insurmountable technical obstacles.

The proof itself depends on the type of project and media being used. However, there are standard ways of showing competency in a given craft. For specific recommendations for the project proof of concept, see the proof of concept sections at the bottom of the _**[project categories](https://dmd-program.github.io/art-design-course-resources/)**_ pages.
