# Project research expectations

Research expectations can differ between projects. For the Digital Multimedia Design Capstone course, students can select from a variety of media types that correspond to their fields of interest. Research is integral to the design process that you will be using for the capstone project, and therefore, everyone will incorporate appropriate research methods into their production timelines. The importance of conducting research can be summed up by the following:

**Research...**

1. Contextualizes your work within the broader landscape of work;
2. Helps to base your design work on current standards and the latest thinking in the discipline;
3. Drives your design decisions based on credible ideas, facts, and data â€” communicating the rationale of your design decisions;
4. Eliminates as much harmful bias as possible. Everyone will inevitably bring bias to the design process;
5. A well researched project leads to a credible, unique, and a well designed project .

## Discipline specific

Choose the research that best suits your project's intended outcomes. If you are creating products or services, you may do research into existing ones to better understand what has been done and how your project will stand out. You may conduct visual research for interface design, or use a variety methods to better understand how users might use your design. If you are creating a video game, you may need to research certain relevant history, game theory, or various design research related to developing characters and props in your game. The research that you conduct depends of the scope of work and the main focus of your work. If you are creating a graphic design project, you may start by researching case studies of similar projects, look into the history or context of the subject matter you are designing for, and get a better understanding of client or business goals through a variety of research methods. If you are doing video or photography, perhaps you will do research into other artists, films, or work that you may try to emulate.

Not sure where to start? The [DMD Art and Design Course Resources](https://dmd-program.github.io/art-design-course-resources/) offers a good starting point for many project types.

## Universal requirements

1. All projects will likely include research into the techniques and tools that may be best suited to completing the project.
2. Most projects are visual in nature, and will likely include visual research of some kind.
3. When working with sensitive or discipline specific subjects outside of your expertise such as health, social issues, politics, the environment, etc., you will need to rely on experts or scholarly publications as your source for data.
