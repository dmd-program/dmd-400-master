# Capstone project production report discussions

## Directions:
You will post step 1, and then you may have to return to complete part 2. Try to answer questions from you classmates, as this should be a two-way conversation.

1. **(DUE at due date)** Post a link  to your production blog and write simple summary of your project. The summary should include:
  - The type of project you are making
  - Project timeline up to this point if it's not posted in the production blog
  - What you intended to accomplish in the production report
  - How it's going
  - Problems, challenges, opportunities
  - Respond to any questions that you may get from others.
2. **(DUE within 3 days after due date)** Review at least 3 classmates' work and leave feedback. Pay attention to the following:
  - You liking the project is nice, but not particularly helpful feedback. Try to help your classmate improve their work.
  - Use art and design vocabulary where applicable
  - Does the student's project seem like it's on track based on the timeline?
  - Identify artists, designers, or related projects to recommend for inspiration.
  - If there are visuals, or other production assets included in the production report, how well are they working? Do you have any suggestions for improvement? 
  - Make recommendations for improving either the work or the production reports. Ask clarifying questions if you are confused or unsure what is happening in the production.

## Rubric:

You will be graded based on the completeness of your production report and your feedback and comments on peer work as described in the instructions.

1. Posted a blog link and included the summary requirements on time.
2. Commented on at least three peer reports on time. (Please choose another report to comment on if it already has three postings.)
