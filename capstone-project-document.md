# Capstone project document

Develop a project document that gives readers a clear understanding of your project, from beginning to end. This may be very similar to a project explainer video, where you essentially cover all aspects of the project.

Documents should be created in **Adobe InDesign** if possible. Documents produced in MS Word are less preferred, but acceptable. InDesign allows greater customization with layout and typography, to allow you to showcase your design abilities and ensure you are familiar with Adobe's industry standard publication software.
